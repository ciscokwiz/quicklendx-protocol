# QuickLendX Protocol — Complete Event Schema Reference

> **Version:** 1.0  
> **Source of truth:** `src/events.rs`  
> **Off-chain indexers:** subscribe to the `TOPIC_*` constants; never hard-code string literals.

---

## Overview

All protocol state transitions emit structured events via `env.events().publish(topics, data)`.
Events are the canonical mechanism for off-chain indexers, analytics pipelines, and audit tooling
to reconstruct protocol state without querying contract storage directly.

### Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Schema stability** | `TOPIC_*` constants are compile-time `&str` values; any rename is a breaking change |
| **No PII** | No customer names, tax IDs, or private metadata appear in any event payload |
| **Determinism** | Events depend only on validated contract state; no external randomness |
| **Gas efficiency** | `#[contractevent]` macro generates minimal XDR; topics use `Symbol::new` |
| **Semantic aliases** | Domain names (`InvoiceCreated`, `FundsLocked`, `LoanSettled`, `DisputeOpened`) are type aliases to canonical structs |

---

## Semantic Aliases

The task specification uses domain-level names. These are type aliases to canonical event types:

| Domain Name | Canonical Type | Topic Constant |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| `InvoiceCreated` | `InvoiceUploaded` | `TOPIC_INVOICE_UPLOADED` = `"invoice_uploaded"` |
| `FundsLocked` | `EscrowCreated` | `TOPIC_ESCROW_CREATED` = `"escrow_created"` |
| `LoanSettled` | `InvoiceSettled` | `TOPIC_INVOICE_SETTLED` = `"invoice_settled"` |
| `DisputeOpened` | `DisputeCreated` | `TOPIC_DISPUTE_CREATED` = `"dispute_created"` |

---

## Invoice Events

### `InvoiceUploaded` / `InvoiceCreated`

## Security Guarantees

### No PII in Events

The following fields are **explicitly excluded** from all event payloads:

- Customer names
- Tax IDs / VAT numbers
- Contact information
- Private metadata fields

The `InvoiceMetadataUpdated` event emits only `line_item_count` and `total_value` — never `customer_name` or `tax_id`.

### Tamper-Proof Timestamps

All `timestamp` fields use `env.ledger().timestamp()`, which is set by the Stellar network consensus and cannot be manipulated by contract callers.

### No Events on Failed Transactions

Soroban's execution model guarantees that if a contract function panics or returns an error, all state changes (including event emissions) are rolled back. This means:

- Failed bid placements emit zero events
- Duplicate dispute attempts emit zero events
- Unauthorized operations emit zero events

This is verified by the negative tests in `src/test_events.rs`.

### Determinism

Events depend only on validated contract state. No external randomness, no block hashes, no caller-supplied timestamps are used in event payloads.

## Off-Chain Indexer Integration

To subscribe to QuickLendX events from a Stellar Horizon or RPC node:

```typescript
// Subscribe to all invoice lifecycle events
const INVOICE_TOPICS = [
  "invoice_uploaded",
  "invoice_verified",
  "invoice_cancelled",
  "invoice_settled",
  "invoice_defaulted",
  "invoice_expired",
  "invoice_funded",
];

// Subscribe to bid events
const BID_TOPICS = [
  "bid_placed",
  "bid_accepted",
  "bid_withdrawn",
  "bid_expired",
];

// Subscribe to escrow events
const ESCROW_TOPICS = [
  "escrow_created",   // == FundsLocked
  "escrow_released",
  "escrow_refunded",
];

// Subscribe to dispute events
const DISPUTE_TOPICS = [
  "dispute_created",       // == DisputeOpened
  "dispute_under_review",
  "dispute_resolved",
];
```

Import the `TOPIC_*` constants from `src/events.rs` directly in any Rust-based indexer to avoid string drift.
