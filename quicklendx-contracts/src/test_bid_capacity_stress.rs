//! Maximum-capacity stress suite for `MAX_BIDS_PER_INVOICE` (50).
//!
//! See issue #1299. Worst-case ordering bugs, off-by-one pagination errors,
//! and instruction-budget blow-ups surface at the documented ceiling. A
//! protocol can be correct with three bids and still mis-rank or run out of
//! budget at fifty. This suite drives the documented hot paths to the
//! documented maximum.
//!
//! # Coverage
//!
//! - `place_bid` accepts exactly `MAX_BIDS_PER_INVOICE` and rejects the 51st
//!   with the canonical `MaxBidsPerInvoiceExceeded` error.
//! - `rank_bids` returns a fully-ordered 50-element ranking obeying the
//!   documented comparator chain
//!   (`profit → expected_return → bid_amount → timestamp → bid_id`).
//! - `get_best_bid` equals the head of `rank_bids` at full capacity.
//! - `cleanup_expired_bids_paged` drains a 50-bid set across multiple
//!   pages and stays consistent across re-runs.
//!
//! # Edge cases
//!
//! - **Pure final tiebreaker**: 50 identical bids differing only in
//!   `bid_id` (placed back-to-back so the ledger timestamp is constant),
//!   forcing every comparator except bid_id to tie.
//! - **All 50 expired in a single ledger slot**: full-coverage sweep
//!   cleans the lot and a re-run is fully idempotent.
//! - **Alternating expired/active across page boundaries**: chunked
//!   page-by-page cleanup isolates the partial-coverage path. A full
//!   coverage follow-up settles the storage counter; a final pass then
//!   observes the compacted, idempotent state.
//!
//! # Note on storage vs. index
//!
//! `count_bids_by_status` walks the per-invoice **index** (`count_key`
//! + per-position bid entries), not the full bid struct namespace.
//! `cleanup_expired_bids_paged` updates the index (and removes expired
//! entries from it on full coverage) but does **not** physically delete
//! the `Bid` structs from storage. So after a cleanup:
//!
//! - `get_ranked_bids` / `get_best_bid` / `count_bids_by_status` only
//!   see the surviving index entries (Placed bids only).
//! - `BidStorage::get_bid(&env, &original_bid_id)` continues to return
//!   the original `Bid` struct, with `status == Expired` for any bid
//!   that was cleaned.
//!
//! Tests that need to confirm the `Placed → Expired` transition on the
//! underlying `Bid` struct use `BidStorage::get_bid` directly.
